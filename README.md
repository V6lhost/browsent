# Browsent

## About
A simple web-based file and text sharing application. It is enough for one of the clients to install the application; the other clients don't need any application other than a web browser.
*Fun fact: I chose "sent" instead of "send". Because file sharing over Wifi/Internet very fast :D*

## Tech in Background
In the background, I'm taking advantage of Python and Django's capabilities and practicality. They allow me to quickly turn my ideas into code, test them and fix errors more easily.

## How Did I Decide to Build This App
I always need to share files and texts between my devices, as well as with my friend's devices. I've tried several applications for this purpose, but none of them fully met my needes. So I decided to build this app.

# to-do
- [x] Complete Readme
- [x] Write a base working code
- [ ] Switch Django models instead of custom /tmp file manager
- [ ] Add compability for other operating systems
- [ ] Create a local management panel
- [ ] Add an authentication system and permissions
- [ ] Create a Web management (Admin) panel
- [ ] Redesign entire GUI
- [ ] Final checks and cleaning up the code
- [ ] Add some screenshoots
- [ ] Make documentation about codes
- [ ] Package for Supported Operating Systems
- [ ] Be awesome

## Optional
- [ ] Make a headless version for home servers etc.
- [ ] Add support for P2P, So just a web server may be enough and doesn't slow down transfer speed
